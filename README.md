# crystal
Building a crystal by letting particles doing random walks until they meet the seed-particle.

Setting the number of particles too high may generate crashes, but as this is just a small excersise to 
learn to handle Rust types I most probably won't fix this.

To see the track of one wandering particle set N = 1 and view the result in wandering_crystal.png
For N > 1 the wandering_crystal.png become meaningless (uniformly white for larger N)
